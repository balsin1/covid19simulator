# covid19simulator

With the increasing risk of the global scale pandemic of COVID-19, it is essential that the general public has access to effective and efficient updates on its current status. At the moment, information is scattered across newspapers, media outlets, social media and through word of mouth, with numbers being thrown out without the statistics to back them up. This barrage of information is bound to create confusion in citizens as they struggle to keep up with all outlets of news. To reduce the dependency on such sources, a COVID-19 simulation tool is exactly what the public needs to not only gather accurate statistics on the current state of the virus (i.e. number of cases, deaths and treated patients), but to also understand the data which can be catered to their own needs. A visual representation is always an easy way to interpret data and will give users the current and past statistics necessary to keep up to date with the pandemic and protect their families and friends.
